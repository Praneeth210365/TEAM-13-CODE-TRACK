	<h1>. CodeTrack (.NET Performance Profiler and Execution Analyzer</h1>

	<p>What it is: This is a free performance profiler and execution analyzer specifically for .NET applications. It helps developers identify performance bottlenecks and understand the detailed execution flow of their code.

Key Features:
Performance Profiling: Helps find slow parts of the code.
Execution Analyzer: Provides a detailed view of method calls, including parameters and return values.
Post-mortem debugging: Allows debugging applications after an issue has occurred.
Object instance tracking: See how specific object instances are used throughout execution.
Non-invasive: Can attach to a running process without restarting.
Portable: No installation required, just copy and run.
Offline analysis: Trace data can be collected on one machine and analyzed on another.
Profiling Modes: Offers sampling (for general overview) and tracing (for exact, detailed measurements).
Filtering: Allows developers to specify exactly what code they want to profile.
Plugins and Rulesets: Extensible to capture and display specific data for custom use cases</p>
